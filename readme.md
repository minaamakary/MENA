Welcome to my readme file!

Just to make this easy. 
To run the project successfully all you need to do is 

Run the launch file turtlebot3_empty_world.launch!

You will find it inside thesis --> launch 

The launch file has all the scripts so will run the whole system all together which contains the four main scripts
Distance Measurement - distance_measurement_node.py
Robot current position and angle - pose_orientation_node.py
Navigation - turtle_move_laserscan.py
Mapping - mappingRoom.py

If you need to display only navigation you can comment out the rest of the scripts. But for mapping you need all of them to be running.
